# Linear Regression Project with Python
 This project focuses on implementing and understanding linear regression using Python. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and statistics, used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
# Data
We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
